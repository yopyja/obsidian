# **Securing Hosts and Data**

## **Summarizing Virtualization Concepts**
`Virtualization` allows you to host one or more virtual systems, or `virtual machines` (VMs), on a single physical machine.

When discussing VMs we should understand a few of the following terms:
 - `Hypervisor` - software that creates, runs, and manages the VMs is the Hypervisor.
 - `Host` - physical system hosting the VMs is the host.
 - `Guest` - operating systems running on the host system are guests or guest machines.
 - `Host scalability` - refers to the ability to resize the computing capacity of the VM.
 - `Host elasticity` - refers to the ability to dynamically change resources assigned to the VM based on the load.

> Virtualization typically provides the best `return on investment` (ROI) when an organization has many underutilized servers.

### **Thin Client and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure**

A `thin client` is a computer with enough resources to boot and connect to a server to run specific applications or desktops. While a `virtual desktop infrastructure (vdi)` hosts a user's desktop operating system on a server.

### **Containers**
`Container Virtualization` runs services or applications within isolated `containers` or `application cells`.

```
 [ App ]  [ App ]  [ App  ]
    ‚ÜïÔ∏è        ‚ÜïÔ∏è        ‚ÜïÔ∏è
 [    Host OS Kernel      ]
             ‚Üï
 [ Host Computer Hardware ]     
```

### **VM Escape Protection**  üî•
`VM escape` is an attack that allows an attacker to access the host system from within the virtual system. Vendors release patches to prevent these attacks from happening, stay up to date.

### **VM Sprawl Avoidance**
`VM spawl` occurs when an organization has many VMs that aren't appropriately managed. Ensure policies are up to snuff with the VM management to prune deprecated machines.

### **Replication** 
It's worth pointing out virtual machines are simply files. Making copies of these VM files, you can use them as backups. Replication makes it easy to restore a failed virtual server.

### **Snapshots** üì∏
A `snapshot` provides you with a copy of a VM at a moment in time, which you can use as a backup. Admins commonly take snapshots of systems prior to performing any risky operation.

### **Non-Persistance**
`Persistance` is when a user logs into a vm and makes changes to system files n such... they will stay. `Non-Persistance` is when say a user logs off a vm and the image rolls back to a preconfigured snapshot to save resources.

## **Implementing Secure Systems**

### **Endpoint Security**
`Endpoints` are computing devices such as servers, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, or IoT devices. `Endpoint detection and response (EDR)`, sometimes called `endpoint threat detection and response (EDTR)`, provides continuous monitoring of endpoints.

EDR tools are part of a defense-in-depth strategy. Commonly uses HIDS n such for protection.

### **Hardening Systems**
`Hardening` is the practice of making operating systems (OS) or applications more secure from its default installation. 

### **Configuration Management**
`Configuration Management` practices help organizations deploy systems with secure configurations. Admins often use baselines and imaging with configuration management.

### **Secure Baseline and Integrity**
A `baseline` is a known starting point, and organizations commonly use `secure baselines` to provide known starting points for systems. The use of baselines works in the three steps:
 1. `Initial baseline configuration` - admins use various tools to deploy systems consistently in a secure state.
 2. `Integrity measurements for baseline deviation` - automated tools monitor the system for any baseline changes, which is a common security issue. 
 3. `Remediation` - NAC methods can detect some changes to baseline settings and automatically isolate or quarantine system in a remediation network.

### **Using Master Images for Baseline Configurations**
One of the most common methods of deploying systems is with images starting with a master image.
 1. Admins start with a blank VM and configure it to specification
 2. They then capture the image which it then becomes the `master image`
 3. Lastly they deplo

This provides a `secure starting point` and `reduce costs`

### **Patch Management Policy**
`Patch management` ensures that systems and applications stay up to date with current patches. This is one of the most efficient ways to reduce operating system and application vulnerabilities.

### **Change Management Policy**
The worst enemies of many networks have been unrestrained administrators. Policies / rules of engagement on how to patch, manage, deploy, and delete anything should always be in place to keep everyone accountable.

### **Application Approved Lists and Block Lists**
Whitelisting and blacklisting software on systems duh

### **Application Programming Interfaces**
`Application Programming Interface (API)` - is a software component that gives developers access to features or data within another application, a service, or an operating system.

APIs are susceptible to attacks, so developers need to address several API considerations to ensure that the APIs aren't vulnerable:
 - `Authentication`
 - `Authorization`
 - `Transport level security`

### **Microservice and APIs**
`Microservices` are code modules designed to do one thing well. They are typically small code modules that receive a value and respond with a value.

### **FDE and SED**
`Full disk encryption (FDE)` encrypts an entire disk. `Self-encrypting drives (SEDs)`, also known as hardware-based FDE drives. When users power up the machine, they enter their credentials to decrypt the drive and boot the system

---

### **Boot Integrity**
`Boot integrity` verifies the integrity of the operating system and boot loading systems. A `measured boot` goes through enough of the boot process to perform these checks without allowing a user to interact with the system.

#### **Boot Security and UEFI**
The `Basic Input/Output System(BIOS)` includes software that provides a computer with basic instructions on starting. Newer systems use `Unified Extensible Firmware Interface(UEFI)` instead of BIOS. UEFI performs many of the same functions as BIOS but provides enhancements. For example, it can boot from larger disks, and it is designed to be CPU-independent.

#### **Trusted Platform Module**
A `trusted platform module(TPM)` is a hardware chip on the computer's motherboard that stores cryptographic keys used for encryption.

TPM supports secure `boot attestation` processes. When the system boots, the `secure boot` process checks the files against stored signatures to ensure they haven't changed.

`Remote attestation` process works like the secure boot process. Instead of checking the boot files against the report stored in the TPM, it uses a separate system.

TPMs ship with a unique `Rivest, Shamir, Adleman(RSA)` private key burned to it, which is used for asymmetric encryption and can be sued to support authentication. This private key is matched with a public key and provides a `hardware root of trust` or a known secure starting point.

#### **Hardware Security Module**
A `hardware security module(HSM)` is a security device you can add to system to manage, generate, and securely store cryptographic keys.

A `microSD HSM` is a microSD card that includes an HSM.

### **SEAndroid**
The `security-enhanced Android(SEAndroid)` security model uses the `Security-Enhanced Linux(SELinux)` to enforce access security.
 - `Enforcing mode` - This mode enforces SELinux policy. Any activity that is denied by the policy is blocked and logged.
 - `Permissive mode` - This mode does not enforce the SELinux policy, but does log all activity that the policy would block if it was in enforcing mode. Helpful for testing new systems.

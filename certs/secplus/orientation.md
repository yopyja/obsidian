# Davis Tech Orientation

### Student Services

Before going to class have student services write down your `{student-email}` 
Looks like such `{first}.{last}{last4ofstudentid}@mail.davistech.edu` (i.e. `john.doe1234@mail.davistech.edu`)

Then ask them to reset your email password (as we weren't given one yet) to something temp like `davistech`

### ITPro.TV Account Access
I had to speak with one of the instructors and it seemed to be default set to my `us.af.mil` email but he allowed me to change it and reset the password. I had the account setup for my school email.

### Schedule your exam
When I was on chapter 10/11 I got my exam scheduled a week out on the following friday. Speak with your instructor and get the registration form and fill it out. Bring it to the assessment center (inside student services) and ensure you get it scheduled with them and report to your unit your test date.

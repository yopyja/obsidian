Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP)








MAC  - Mandatory Access Control       - Based on security clearance levels
DAC  - Discretionary Access Control   - You as the owner of data controls access to sed info
RBAC - Role-based access control      - rights are gained implicitly instead of explicitly - discord roles overlap
ABAC - Attribute-based access control - Combines and evaluates multiple parameters - time of day, desired action, position
Rule based Access control. - as if the network is only accessible during a certain time of day

### The Practice of Cyber Security
The problem of dealing with an intelligent opponent requires a different approach, discipline, and mindset compared to facing a naturally-occurring or accidental problem. Whether we are simulating an attack or defending against one, we will need to consider the perspective and potential actions of our opponent, and try to anticipate what they might do. Opponents are human beings with *agency*, they can reason, predict, judge, analyze, conjecture, and deliberate.

> Human beings are a *critical* component of cybersecurity.

Another important aspect of security is that it usually involves *reasoning under uncertainty*. The problem of the intelligent adversary and the problem of uncertainty both suggest that understanding cyber security necessitates learning more about how we think as human agents, and how to solve problems. This means we'll need to adopt and nurture specific mindsets that will help us as we learn and apply our skills.

Security is not only about understanding technology and code, but also about your own mind and that of your adversary. We tend to think of a mindset as *a set of beliefs that inform our personal perspective on something*. Two contrasting examples of well-known mindsets are the *fixed* mindset and the *growth* mindset. An individual with a fixed mindset believes that their skill/talent/capacity to learn is what is and that there is no gain to be made by trying to improve. On the other hand, a growth mindset encourages the belief that mental ability is flexible and adaptable, and that one can grow their capacity to learn over time.

Another extremely valuable mindset is the aptly-coined *security mindset*. Proposed by researcher *Bruce Schneier*, this mindset encourages constant questioning of how one can attack (or defend) a system. OffSec encourages learners to adopt the *Try Harder* mindset. To better understand this mindset, let's quickly consider two potential perspectives in a moment of *failure*.

1. If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current `skills` / `processes` / `configs` / `approach` as much as it is a truth about the system.
2. If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.
